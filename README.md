# Intro

This package is a fork of [rust-mode](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-mode)

Differences with rust-mode:

- [rust-analyzer](https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer) configuration
- flycheck integration
- cargo popup
- multiline error parsing
- translation of ANSI control sequences through [xterm-color](https://github.com/atomontage/xterm-color)
- async org babel
- custom compilation process
- rustfmt errors in a rust compilation mode
- automatic RLS configuration with [eglot](https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot) or [lsp-mode](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode)
- cask for testing
- requires emacs 26
- etc.

# Installation

## From MELPA

* Make sure you have [added MELPA repos](https://melpa.org/#/getting-started).
* `M-x package-install RET rustic RET`.

## From source

* Clone this git repo somewhere (e.g. `~/prog/rustic`).
* Add the path to Emacs `load-path` and associate .rs files with
  rustic by adding this to your init file:

```
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/prog/rustic")
(autoload 'rustic-mode "rustic")
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.rs\\'" . rustic-mode))
```

# Completion

Auto-completion is optionnal and can work with multiple frontends and
backends (see rest of document). To keep this simple, we will use the
default basic setup here. You will need to:

* Install additional Emacs packages: `lsp-mode` and `company`.
* Install additionnal Rust components with `rustup component add rls rustfmt rust-src`.
* Load and configure all of it:

```
(defun my-rust-hook ()
  "This is run on every rust file open"
  ;; enable company if it wasnt already
  (require 'company)
  (company-mode 1)

  ;; bind "force completion request" to key
  (local-set-key (kbd "<C-return>") 'company-complete))

(eval-after-load 'rustic
  '(progn
     (require 'lsp) ;; error without this
     (when (not (require 'yasnippet nil 'no-err))
       (setq lsp-enable-snippet nil)) ;; silence warning
     (add-hook 'rustic-mode-hook 'my-rust-hook)))
```

* Emacs should now show you an autocompletion menu while typing
  identifiers (longer than 3 characters) or while idling in other
  spots.

* To force a request of completion (i.e. after `.` or `::`) you can
  use the `company-complete` function which is bound to `C-return` in
  the above snippet.

If you have `rust-mode` installed, ensure it is required before rustic since it has to be removed
from `auto-mode-alist`. However you only need `rust-mode` if you want to use `emacs-racer`. There's some stuff that isn't included in rustic.

# Compilation

Rustic defines a derived compilation-mode. Colors can be customized with several variables and you can also change the backtrace verbosity by changing the value of `rustic-compile-backtrace`.

Supported compile.el variables:
- compilation-arguments
- compilation-scroll-output (not `first-error`)

# Rustfmt

You can format your code with `rustic-format-buffer` or `rustic-cargo-fmt`.
The variable `rustic-format-on-save` allows you to turn off auto-format on save.
Rustic uses the function `rustic-save-some-buffers` for saving buffers before compilation. 
If you want buffers to be saved automatically, you can change the value of `buffer-save-without-query`.

Note: Rust edition 2018 requires a `rustfmt.toml` file.

# LSP

You can disable LSP support by setting `rustic-rls-pkg` to nil.

## Server

RLS is the default and can be changed to rust-analyzer.

``` emacs-lisp
(setq rustic-lsp-server 'rust-analyzer)
```

## Client

The default package is `lsp-mode`. But you can also use `eglot`.

``` emacs-lisp
(setq rustic-rls-pkg 'eglot)
```

# Rustfix

`rustic-rustfix` runs rustfix, but it seems it's not very mature at this point.
It would be a lot more helpful if we had an indicator for fixable errors and if it would be
possible to run rustfix on a single file.

# Clippy

Rustic automatically configures a checker that runs clippy when `flycheck` is required.
In case you use `flymake`, you have to take care of the configuration yourself.

Currently cargo does not display the correct installation command for some toolchains when
clippy isn't installed. 
If you have problems try it with `rustup component add --toolchain nightly clippy`.

Use `rustic-cargo-clippy` to view the results in a derived compilation mode.

# Flycheck

By default, rustic displays the number of errors and warnings in the mode-line. The variable
`rustic-flycheck-setup-mode-line-p` can be set to `nil` to turn off mode-line modification.

# Org-babel

The executed blocks run asynchronously and a running babel process is indicated by a spinner in the 
mode line. It can be turned off with `rustic-display-spinner`. If you prefer to see the output in a seperate buffer you can set `rustic-babel-display-compilation-buffer` to `t`.

After a successful build, source blocks get formatted by default. This can be changed with 
`rustic-babel-format-src-block`.

It's also possible to use crates in babel blocks.

```
#+BEGIN_SRC rustic :crates '((regex . 0.2))
  extern crate regex;

  use regex::Regex;

  fn main() {
      let re = Regex::new(r"^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$").unwrap();
      assert!(re.is_match("2014-01-01"));
  }
#+END_SRC
```

Supported org babel parameters:

Write to file `:results file :file ~/babel-file`

# Popup

You can execute commands with `rustic-popup`. The list of commands can be customized
with `rustic-popup-commands`. It's also possible to view the command's flags with `h`.
The command `rustic-popup-default-action` (`RET` or `TAB`) allows you to change:

- `RUST_BACKTRACE` environment variable
- `compilation-arguments` for `recompile`
- arguments for `cargo test`

# Cargo outdated

Use `rustic-cargo-outdated` to get a list of dependencies that are out of date. The results 
are displayed in `tabulated-list-mode` and you can use most commands you know from the emacs
package menu. This option requires the rust package `cargo-outdated` to be
installed before being used.

- `u` mark single crate for upgrade
- `U` mark all upgradable crates
- `m` remove mark
- `x` perform marked package menu actions
- `r` refresh crate list
- `q` quit window

## Tests

To run the tests, you will need [Cask](https://github.com/cask/cask).

``` bash
$ cask
$ cask exec ert-runner
```
